## Description
In a group of 3, I developed an EXT2-based core Linux kernel using C and x86 assembly. This OS was capable of running 3 independent terminals and 6 concurrent programs using round-robin scheduling with the support of 10 custom-built system calls. I also Implemented core OS functionalities, including a flat-structured filesystem, interrupt descriptor table, and 3-level paging support (created page directories and tables) for virtualization. Furthermore, I wrote device driver code for implemented devices like PS/2 Keyboard, Real-Time Clock, Programmable Interval Timer, and 8259 PIC.
Earned a score of 101% for this final project.
