## MP2 - Tux Controller integrated with a fruit maze game
In the first checkpoint, I implemented basic features for the maze game like masking, drawing pixels, modifying the color palette of objects, and dealing with obstacle-based edge cases. In the second checkpoint, I added Tux controller support to control the player in the game and implemented a digital timer for each level. This used concepts of device drivers and synchronization mechanisms.
## MP3 - Linux Kernel Final Project
In a group of 3, I developed an EXT2-based core Linux OS using C and x86 assembly. This OS was capable of running 3 independent terminals and 6 concurrent programs using round-robin scheduling with the support of 10 custom-built system calls. I also Implemented core OS functionalities, including a flat-structured filesystem, interrupt descriptor table, and 3-level paging support (created page directories and tables) for virtualization. Furthermore, I wrote device driver code for implemented devices like PS/2 Keyboard, Real-Time Clock, Programmable Interval Timer, and 8259 PIC.
I earned a 101% score for this project.
